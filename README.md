# fasterreader

Small tool to read faster, I used to use a similar thing in the past but that app got paywalled and then delisted :/.

Enter your text in the first box, the words per minute in the second box (adult average is 200wpm) and press GO, pretty simple.

The reset button is to reset the array index. Code is really not protected at all bc I intended to use it for myself.
Might add protections in the future.
